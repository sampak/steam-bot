# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - steam-bot
  - backend

steam-bot-build:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  image: node:18-alpine3.14
  stage: steam-bot
  script: 
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - cd steam-bot
    - npm install --force
    - CI=false npm run build
    - echo "Compile steam bot complete."

# steam-bot-test:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
